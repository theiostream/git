/*
 * Iterate over a directory tree.
 *
 * Iterate over a directory tree, recursively, including paths of all
 * types and hidden paths. Skip "." and ".." entries.
 *
 * Every time dir_iterator_advance() is called, update the members of
 * the dir_iterator structure to reflect the next path in the
 * iteration. The order that paths are iterated over within a
 * directory is undefined.
 *
 * A typical iteration looks like this:
 *
 *     int ok;
 *     struct iterator *iter = dir_iterator_begin(path, flags);
 *
 *     while ((ok = dir_iterator_advance(iter)) == ITER_OK) {
 *             if (want_to_stop_iteration()) {
 *                     ok = dir_iterator_abort(iter);
 *                     break;
 *             }
 *
 *             // Access information about the current path:
 *             if (S_ISDIR(iter->st.st_mode))
 *                     printf("%s is a directory\n", iter->relative_path);
 *     }
 *
 *     if (ok != ITER_DONE)
 *             handle_error();
 *
 * Callers are allowed to modify iter->path while they are working,
 * but they must restore it to its original contents before calling
 * dir_iterator_advance() again.

 * - DIR_ITERATOR_POST_ORDER_TRAVERSAL: the iterator shall return
 *   a dirpath it has found after iterating through that directory's
